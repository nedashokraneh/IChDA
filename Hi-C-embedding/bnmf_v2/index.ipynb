    "#### The Chinese University of Hong Kong\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Hi-C is a powerful experimental method to probe DNA-DNA long-range interactions on the whole genome [Lieberman-Aiden2009].\n",
    "\n",
    "We developed a novel computational method using a balanced non-negative matrix factorization (BNMF) that can flexibly identify small clusters of spatially proximal genomic regions based on Hi-C contact maps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we give examples on how to use our tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Materials and Methods\n",
    "The environmental requirement is:\n",
    "- python 2.7 (https://www.python.org)\n",
    "- numpy (http://www.numpy.org/)\n",
    "- matplotlib (http://matplotlib.org/)\n",
    "- scipy [optional] (http://www.scipy.org/)\n",
    "- numexpr [optional] (https://github.com/pydata/numexpr)\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, you can use the free installer provided by [Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/) to avoid any configuration issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Download the [bnmf package](bnmf_v2.tar.gz) that contains source codes and data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uncompress it and you will see\n",
    "  - `contact_map.py` -- source code for BNMF\n",
    "  - `yeast_chr_len.txt` -- chromosome lengths for the yeast genome\n",
    "  - `hg18_chr_len.txt` -- chromosome lengths for the human genome using hg18 reference\n",
    "  - `HindIII_intersect_EcoRI_fdr0.01_inter.txt` -- yeast inter-chromosome interactions [Duan2010]\n",
    "  - `HindIII_intersect_EcoRI_fdr0.01_intra.txt` -- yeast intra-chromosome interactions [Duan2010]\n",
    "  - `origins_nonCDR_early.txt` -- yeast early origin sites [Duan2010]\n",
    "  - `IMR90.uij.chr22` -- human intra-chromosome interaction matrix at 40k resolution [Dixon2012]\n",
    "  - `IMR90.domain.txt` -- topological domains defined for IMR90 cell line [Dixon2012]\n",
    "  - `*.ipynb` -- the raw files used to generate this tutorial\n",
    "  - `*.html` -- ipython notebook files transformed into html format\n",
    "  \n",
    "Then, let's go through following examples:\n",
